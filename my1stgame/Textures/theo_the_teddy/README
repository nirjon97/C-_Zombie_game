Theo the Teddy-Bear
and a journey into pixellands

A cartoon model initially modelled to test and demonstrate the possibility of prerendered pixel-art sprites.
It should not resemble any special character but is just a generic cartoon mammal.
The model was modelled and rigged in MisfitModel 3D, a simple open source mesher.
You may adjust it's pose in animation mode and save an animation sequence outside of animation mode.
The spritify folder contains examples of sprite downscaling.
The gimping.xcf file contains the steps in (invisible) layers necessary to create pixel-art'ish sprites from renderings.

Things to consider when creating sprite models and bitmaps:
- Small details may not be visible at the intended resolution.
- Make modelproportions larger for parts that need detail=pixels (esp. head and eyes).
- Choose a clear and largescale color scheme.
- Keep lighting and reflections low if you intend a flatter non-rendered look.
- Haven't tried ambient occlusion - may look better than directional lighting.
- Use as much polygons as you want/can so you can reuse the model for advertising.
- When adding outlines make them about as big as an upscaled pixel of your target-resolution would be.
- There is a lot you may wish to tweak to your likings.
- And remember: Garbage in => garbage out.

The whole process - once you know your parameters - could be burned to scripts (eg for imagemagick) to automatically create sprites from renderings for your art-pipeline.
